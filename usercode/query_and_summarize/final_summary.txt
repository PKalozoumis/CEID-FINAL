Childhood obesity is a significant public health concern worldwide, with a rapid growth in prevalence over the last decade. Research suggests that several factors contribute to this issue, often occurring together and having a negative impact on children's health, quality of life, and healthcare systems.

Poor diet and lack of physical activity are among the primary behaviours contributing to childhood obesity. A diet consisting of unhealthy eating habits can have severe consequences, including at least 300,000 preventable deaths each year, with cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death in African Americans, particularly in rural southern regions. In contrast, regular physical activity is essential for maintaining a healthy weight and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer.

Excessive screen time and stress are also significant lifestyle factors contributing to childhood obesity. Spending too much time in front of screens can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, while stress can cause unhealthy eating habits and decreased motivation to engage in physical activity. Furthermore, family relationships play a crucial role in determining a child's likelihood of developing obesity.

Studies have shown that children from families with lower socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected by obesity. However, other factors such as place of residence do not seem to contribute significantly to the issue. A report from Kerala showed that the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children increased in both urban and rural areas.

In the United States, childhood obesity is a growing concern, affecting over 50% of children who will grow into adults at risk for developing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Effective management of risk factors, including dietary practices and physical activity, is crucial to prevent adult morbidity and mortality statistics from declining.

Childhood obesity also has negative psychosocial outcomes, including low self-esteem and depression, which can indirectly affect academic performance and social outcomes. Primary care providers (PCPs) have an essential role in preventing and treating childhood obesity through various strategies, such as weight status assessment and monitoring, healthy lifestyle promotion, community program referrals, clinician skill development, clinical infrastructure development, and policy advocacy.

In conclusion, childhood obesity is a complex issue influenced by several primary behaviours and lifestyle factors. Understanding these contributing factors is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies to address this significant public health concern.

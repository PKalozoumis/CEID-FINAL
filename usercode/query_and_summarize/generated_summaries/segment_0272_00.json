{"created_with": "llm", "summary": "Childhood obesity is a growing concern in the US, affecting over 50% of children who will grow into adults at risk for developing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Effective management of risk factors, including dietary practices and physical activity, is crucial to prevent adult morbidity and mortality statistics from declining. Childhood obesity also has negative psychosocial outcomes, including low self-esteem and depression, and is indirectly linked to academic performance and social outcomes. Unhealthy eating contributes to at least 300,000 preventable deaths each year, with cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death in African Americans, particularly in rural southern regions."}

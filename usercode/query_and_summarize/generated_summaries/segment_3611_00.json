{"created_with": "llm", "summary": "Childhood and adult obesity is a significant health concern affecting ethnic minorities, women, and individuals from lower socioeconomic groups. African Americans are disproportionately affected by obesity and its related health consequences, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Factors contributing to obesity include metabolic syndrome indicators, regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, glucocorticoid sensitivity, insulin resistance, and lack of physical activity. Physical inactivity is a major contributor to obesity, particularly among African Americans and Hispanic populations. Sedentary lifestyle contributes to cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. The criteria for diagnosing metabolic syndrome need to be modified to account for racial and ethnic differences."}
